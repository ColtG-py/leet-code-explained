## I'm not the best, but it's fine.

I'm not the smartest engineer, nor am I the most well spoken nor well written. I'm very average. I struggle with syntax. I struggle with data structures. I make dumb mistakes, forget to write documentation, and neglect unit tests.

All this to say, I'm a very human software developer. Likely a "**1x**", by industry standards. But I'm improving, and I want to learn more about being a great engineer in my own mind. Being my version of a "great" engineer is not just about my innate talent but also about constant learning, perseverance, and my ability to adapt. In other words, I don't care how good you are, or how good someone is who works in **FAANG**. I'm on my path, my "pursuit of happiness", but unlike Kid Cudi I won't be fine once I get it, because "it" is a moving target.

So, I want to track this journey, which is the point of this site. And there will be an outcome for you; I'll use my own lack of knowledge to explain these things in dead simple terms. So let's all pursue our own journeys independently, but work together to help each other. 

Remember, no one can fault you for trying and failing. But you can, and will, be faulted for failing to try.
