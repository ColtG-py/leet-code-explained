Late in July during the year of 2023, three friends sat down for another **adventure**. This digital **adventure** would take place in Azeroth; a common haunt for them over the years. Inspired by previous literature and in-game companion texts, these friends decided to chronicle their experiences on this adventure in order to share and capture the magic of perma-death games. This is that chronicle.

This is a dramatic re-telling of true events through our time playing three characters: a headstrong warrior, a trouble-making rogue, and an aloof hunter. With one catch; dying is permanent.
